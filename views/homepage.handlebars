      What is Dysphagia?
    </h2>
      Dysphagia is a swallowing disorder that has many causes
      including but not limited to stroke, Parkinson's disease, ALS, and head
      and neck cancer. Dysphagia can be mild to severe. A speech-language
      pathologist can recommend a modified diet and swallowing techniques to
      help you manage your dysphagia.

      Please talk to your doctor and a speech-language pathologist before making
      any changes to your diet or swallowing routine.
